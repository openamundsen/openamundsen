## Overview

openAMUNDSEN is a fully distributed model, designed primarily for resolving the mass and energy
balance of snow and ice covered surfaces in mountain regions.
Typically, it is applied in areas ranging from the point scale to the regional scale (i.e., up to
some hundreds to thousands of square kilometers), using a spatial resolution of 10–100 m and a
temporal resolution of 1–3 h, however its potential applications are very versatile.

Main features include:

* Spatial interpolation of scattered meteorological point measurements using a combined lapse
  rate – inverse distance weighting scheme
* Calculation of solar radiation taking into account terrain slope and orientation, hill shading
  and atmospheric transmission losses and gains due to scattering, absorption, and reflections
* Adjustment of precipitation using several correction functions for wind-induced undercatch and
  redistribution of snow using terrain-based parameterizations
* Simulation of the snow and ice mass and energy balance using either a multilayer scheme or a
  bulk-layering scheme using separate layers for new snow, old snow, firn and ice
* Modification of the meteorological variables for inside-canopy conditions in forested areas and
  calculation of forest snow processes (interception, sublimation and melt unload)
* Calculation of snowmelt using the surface energy balance or a temperature index/enhanced
  temperature index method
* Calculation of evapotranspiration for snow-free surfaces using the FAO Penman-Monteith method
* Usage of arbitrary timesteps (e.g. 10 minutes, daily) while resampling forcing data to the
  desired time resolution if necessary
* Flexible output of time series including arbitrary model variables for selected point locations in
  NetCDF or CSV format
* Flexible output of gridded model variables, either for specific dates or periodically (e.g., daily
  or monthly), optionally aggregated to averages or sums in NetCDF, GeoTIFF or ASCII Grid format
* Live view window for displaying the model state in real time

## Quick start

### Installation

openAMUNDSEN is a Python (3.7+) package and compatible with all major platforms (Linux, macOS,
Windows) and architectures.

To help keep its dependencies separated from other Python packages installed on your system, we
recommend to install it either from within a conda environment (if you are using the
[conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) package manager) or a standard Python [virtual
environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).

#### Using conda

When using conda, the recommended steps to install openAMUNDSEN are:

1. Install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (recommended) or
   [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads) by downloading and executing
   the installer for your operating system and architecture.
2. From the terminal, create a conda environment for openAMUNDSEN by running

   `conda create --name openamundsen pip`
3. Activate the environment by running

   `source activate openamundsen`
4. Install openAMUNDSEN by running

   `pip install openamundsen`

The above steps should work on Linux and macOS.
On Windows, please follow these slightly different installation commands (since the required package
[rasterio](https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio) currently cannot be installed on Windows using pip,
this package must first be installed using conda):

```
conda create --name openamundsen pip
conda activate openamundsen
conda install --channel=conda-forge rasterio
pip install openamundsen
```

#### Using virtualenv

If you want to install openAMUNDSEN in a virtual environment instead:

1. Create a virtualenv in the current working directory by running

   `python3 -m venv openamundsen`

2. Activate the environment by running

   `source openamundsen/bin/activate`

3. Install openAMUNDSEN by running

   `pip install openamundsen`

### Examples

Example data sets for running the model can be downloaded from
https://github.com/openamundsen/openamundsen-examples.

## Setting up a model run

### Input data

Required input data for running the model is at the least:

* a digital elevation model (DEM) as an [Arc/Info ASCII
  Grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esri_grid) (.asc) file in a projected coordinate reference
  system, with the same spatial resolution in which the model should be run,
* and time series of the meteorological variables air temperature, precipitation, relative humidity,
  global radiation and wind speed in NetCDF or CSV format.

Optionally, a region of interest (ROI) file can be additionally supplied defining a subset of the
DEM area in which the model should be applied.
All model calculations are then only performed for the pixels which are marked as 1 in the ROI file.

#### Spatial input data

The DEM file must be named `dem_{domain}_{resolution}.asc`, where `{domain}` refers to the (freely
selectable) name of the respective model domain, and `{resolution}` to the spatial resolution in m.
Accordingly, the ROI file (if available) is named `roi_{domain}_{resolution}.asc`.

#### Meteorological input data

Meteorological input time series must be provided in the same or higher temporal resolution in which
the model should be run.
For each point location, a CSV or NetCDF file covering the entire time series must be provided.

##### CSV input

When using CSV as input format, the input files should have one or more of the following columns
(columns for variables not available can be omitted):

* `date`: timestamp as a
  [`pd.to_datetime`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.to_datetime.html)-compatible
  string (e.g. `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`)
* `temp`: air temperature (K)
* `precip`: precipitation sum (kg m<sup>-2</sup>)
* `rel_hum`: relative humidity (%)
* `sw_in`: global radiation (W m<sup>-2</sup>)
* `wind_speed`: wind speed (m s<sup>-1</sup>)

Additionally, a `stations.csv` file containing the metadata of the point locations must be provided
containing the following columns:

* `id`: station ID, corresponding to the filename of the respective data file
* `name`: station name
* `x`: longitude or projected x coordinate
* `y`: latitude or projected y coordinate
* `alt`: altitude (m)

##### NetCDF input

When using NetCDF as input format, for each station a NetCDF file containing the meteorological time
series and the station metadata is read in (i.e., no additional metadata file is required in this
case).
The NetCDF files are expected to conform to the following schema (unavailable variables can be
omitted):

```
netcdf dummy {
dimensions:
        time = UNLIMITED ;
variables:
        double alt ;
                alt:_FillValue = NaN ;
                alt:standard_name = "surface_altitude" ;
                alt:units = "m" ;

                pr:units = "kg m-2 s-1" ;
        float rsds(time) ;
                rsds:_FillValue = NaNf ;
                rsds:standard_name = "surface_downwelling_shortwave_flux_in_air" ;
                rsds:units = "W m-2" ;
        float tas(time) ;
                tas:_FillValue = NaNf ;

                tas:units = "K" ;
        int64 time(time) ;
                time:standard_name = "time" ;
                time:units = "hours since 1999-01-01 00:00:00" ;
                time:calendar = "proleptic_gregorian" ;
        float wss(time) ;
                wss:_FillValue = NaNf ;
                wss:standard_name = "wind_speed" ;
                wss:units = "m s-1" ;

// global attributes:
                :Conventions = "CF-1.6" ;
                :station_name = "dummy" ;
}
```

### Configuration

The configuration of an openAMUNDSEN model run can either be read in from a
[YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) file or be passed directly as a dictionary from within
Python.

This is an example of a YAML configuration file:

```yaml

    cold_snow_decay_timescale: 480 # albedo decay timescale for cold (T < 0 °C) snow (h)
    melting_snow_decay_timescale: 200 # albedo decay timescale for melting snow (h)
    refresh_snowfall: 0.5 # snowfall amount for resetting albedo to the maximum value (kg m-2 h-1)
```

Only few configuration parameters (`domain`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `resolution`, `timezone` and
the input data directories) are mandatory, for all other parameters default values are used
otherwise.
A detailed documentation of all model parameters will be available soon (in
the meantime, the available parameters and their default values can be looked up in
[configschema.yml](./openamundsen/data/configschema.yml)).

### Running the model

When the input data and the model configuration have been prepared, a model run can be started either
using the `openamundsen` command line utility (`openamundsen config_file.yml`), or from within
Python using the following syntax:

```python
import openamundsen as oa

config = oa.read_config('config_file.yml')  # read in configuration file
model = oa.OpenAmundsen(config)  # create OpenAmundsen object and populate unspecified parameters with default values
model.initialize()  # read in input data files, initialize state variables etc.
model.run()  # run the model
```
